        "abstract": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) has received a complete Underground Injection Control (UIC) primacy application from the State of Arizona requesting primary enforcement responsibility (primacy) for Class I-VI injection wells under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) section 1422. The EPA's approval of the State's UIC program primacy application would allow the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) to authorize underground injection for all underground injection wells regulated under the Federal SDWA and ensure compliance with UIC program requirements. The EPA proposes to issue a final rule approving Arizona's application to implement the UIC program for Class I-VI injection wells located within the State, except those on Indian lands. The EPA proposes amendments to reflect this proposed approval of Arizona's UIC program primacy application.",

        "abstract": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve revisions to the Ohio State Implementation Plan (SIP). On November 6, 2024, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) submitted the state's plans for maintaining the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS or standard) in the Columbus, Ohio; Cleveland-Akron-Lorain, Ohio; and Cincinnati, Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana areas. EPA is proposing to approve these maintenance plans because they provide for the maintenance of the 2008 ozone NAAQS for each area for 10 additional years as required by the Clean Air Act (CAA). EPA is also initiating the adequacy review process for motor vehicle emission budgets (Budgets) for each area. This action, if finalized, would make certain commitments related to maintenance of the 2008 ozone NAAQS in these areas federally enforceable as part of the Ohio SIP.",

This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2020-06-18, would revise the applicability to include Model A321-253NY airplanes, and would prohibit the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR).

AD 2022-15-05 requires repetitive high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections for cracks on the web horizontal flange and inner cap, and applicable corrective actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-15-05, additional cracks have been found at the door stop fitting number 1 holes at frame (FR) 68, after disassembly of the door stop fitting as part of the inspections required by AD 2022-15-05. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2022-15-05, but with reduced compliances times for some inspections, and would require an additional inspection at door stop fitting number 1, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
